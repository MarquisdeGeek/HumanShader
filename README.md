# HumanShader
A checker and renderer for https://humanshader.com/

# Backstory

I wrote this because I had little faith in seeing the finished shader :)

Now that it's almost complete, I feel happy in releasing something that many might consider a cheat.


# Preparing it

```
npm i
```

# Running it

```
node check.js 29 14
```

# Seeing it

```
node solve.js
```
